**Abstract:**  
Optical camera communication (OCC) leverages camera image sensors for data reception from light sources but faces challenges of low data rates and high bit error rates. This study introduces an OCC system combining orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with a UNet-based equalizer for signal denoising. Using pixel rows as transmission units, the system achieves a data rate of 9.2 kbps and a bit error rate of 
 at 1 m. Python scripts facilitate system control, optimization, and embedded deployment, highlighting OCCâ€™s potential for next-generation communication systems with improved performance over conventional methods.
